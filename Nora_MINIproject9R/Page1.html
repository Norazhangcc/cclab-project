    <h3 class="t1">Glass Animals</h3>
    <p class="t2">Glass Animals are a British indie rock band formed in Oxford in 2010. Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums. The first, Zaba (2014), spawned the single "Gooey", which was eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full album, How to Be a Human Being, received generally positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the Mercury Prize shortlist. The third, Dreamland, their first fully autobiographical album (Bayley had said he felt it was selfish to write about oneself), included the single "Tokyo Drifting" which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart.<br>

In their live shows they play re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. Their song "Heat Waves" reached number one in Australia in February 2021 and was voted number one on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020.</p>

  <h3 class="t1">Dreamland Album</h3>
  <p class="t2">Dreamland is the third studio album by English indie rock band Glass Animals. It was released on 7 August 2020, having been pushed back from its initial release date of 10 July 2020.<br>

Dreamland is the band's first album since How to Be a Human Being (2016) and was conceived in the aftermath of their drummer being involved in a near-fatal collision in July 2018. The album was written and produced almost entirely by frontman Dave Bayley and features heavily autobiographical lyrics, a radical difference from the band's previous work. It derives musical and lyrical inspiration from Bayley's childhood in Texas, particularly from the popular culture and media of 1990s and early 2000s America. The album has been described as being "drenched in" nostalgia[2] and is structured around a series of interludes of audio from Bayley's childhood home videos. Dreamland was influenced by the R&B and hip hop music from the early 2000s, and features an appearance from American rapper Denzel Curry.<br>

Five singles were released from the album prior to its release: "Tokyo Drifting" (with Denzel Curry), "Your Love (Déjà Vu)", the eponymously named "Dreamland", "Heat Waves" and "It's All So Incredibly Loud". A visual album, entitled Dreamland: The Home Movies, was released on VHS shortly after the album's release. Upon its release, Dreamland received mostly favourable reviews.</p>
