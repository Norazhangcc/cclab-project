    <h3> <a href=""></a>General Introduction: Federalist No. 1 (Alexander Hamilton)</h3>
    <p>The opening statement was bold and rather bald, characteristically Hamiltonian in style. The American people, "after an unequivocal experience of the inefficacy of the subsisting Federal Government," were not being called on to consider the adoption of an entirely new United States constitution, a subject of paramount importance. It involved "nothing less than the existence of the UNION . . . the fate of an empire, in many respects, the most interesting in the world." A wrong decision here would "deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind."</p>

    <h1>Anticipating sharp criticism of the proposed constitution, and active opposition to it, Hamilton grouped dissidents into several categories. There were those constitutionally opposed to any change, no matter what. There were those who feared that a change might cost them their jobs. There were those who liked to fish in troubled waters.</h1>

    <p>The largest body consisted of men of "upright intentions" whose opposition arose "from sources, blameless at least, if not respectable, the honest errors of minds led astray by preconceived jealousies and fears." This group was "so numerous indeed and so powerful" that it might give a "false bias to the judgment" that would be fatal, leading to a "torrent of angry and malignant passions" aroused by the loudness of their voices and the bitterness of their invective. <br>
    The debate on both sides should be conducted with moderation, for "nothing could be more ill judged than that intolerant spirit, which has, at all times, characterised political parties."</p>

    <h4>General Introduction: Federalist No. 3 (Jay)</h4>
    <p>All wise and free people directed their attention to "providing for their safety." Was cause of war as "likely to be given by United America, as by disunited America?"</p>

      <li>Noting that some American states bordered on British and Spanish territories, Jay remarked that the borderers,</li>
     <li>mpulse of sudden irritation, and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury," were the most likely to excite war with</li>
