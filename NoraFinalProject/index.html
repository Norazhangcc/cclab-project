      <h1>Vague Synaesthesia </h1>
      <p>“Vague Synaesthesia” demonstrates fragments of memories that are closely related to people’s feelings, moods, sentiments, and emotions but are hard to describe and picture in words or cannot remember the factual details and specific objects. It creates blurred and dreamy images to visualize fragments of memories through pixel manipulation and generative art, and then hopes to stimulate user’s synesthesia by presenting an image that is vague enough to encompass a kind of universality, therefore, everyone approaches the work with their subjective memories and experiences. This project will finally combine the images formed by the users into a collection of pixel manipulation , which demonstrates different memory with different experiences, emotions.</p>
