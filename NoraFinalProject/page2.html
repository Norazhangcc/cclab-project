    <h2>Concept of "Vague Synaesthesia"</h2>
  </div>

    <div class="concept-text">

      <p>Recalling fragments of memories can evoke the full spectrum of human emotion, from joy to fear, anger or grief. You’ve probably experienced having a flash of memory that caused you to feel an intense emotion — likely reminiscent of the emotion you felt at the time of the event. However,  when you recall these fragments of memories, you may only be able to remember the mood, sentiment, and emotion experienced at the time, instead of the factual details and specific objects of what was happening at the time. To some extent, fragments of memories are largely associated with feelings, and it is difficult for you to articulate or express them clearly in words, and individuals may retain the feelings and emotions associated with an event for much longer than they retain the factual details or visual images of the event. <br>


Therefore, through this project, I hope to show the fragments of memories that are closely related to people’s feelings, moods, sentiments, and emotions but are hard to describe and picture in words or cannot remember the factual details and specific objects. I will create blurred and dreamy images to fit this concept of fragments of memories, and then hope to stimulate the user’s synesthesia through this representation of memory fragments. <br>



Synesthesia is a perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway. For example, a person with synaesthesia might see the color blue when they hear the word ‘fish’ or, as in mirror-touch synaesthesia, they would feel a physical sense of touch on their own bodies when they witness touch to other people or objects. This inter-sensory mixing is caused when the brain uses the resources usually used for seeing for other senses.
<br>
In my project, I wish to transform the real scene into a blurred, dreamy image, in order to show the concept of memory fragmentation embodied above, on the basis of which I hope that this representation of memory fragmentation will stimulate the user’s synesthetic experience.  The goal is to present an image that is vague enough to encompass a kind of universality, therefore, everyone approaches the work with their subjective memories and experiences. This synesthetic aesthetic experience may be associated with the context created by the abstracted surroundings or overall effect of the current image, which in turn leads the user to associate other aspects of emotions, experiences, sensations with it.</p>
